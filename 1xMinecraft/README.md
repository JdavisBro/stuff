# minecraft but 1 pixel
this script takes minecraft assets input and averages out the colour for each texture

extract the assets folder from the minecraft jar (.minecraft/versions/*version*/*version*.jar) into the folder with do.py in
run do.py
a zip appears! that is your resource pack
there are some options inside do.py to change it to be more 1x but more shit

this does work with mods just extract the mods assets too!
